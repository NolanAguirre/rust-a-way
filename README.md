# rust-away
This repo is for me to keep from getting rusty in languages I don't often write in, it will also hold stuff that I plan on learning in the future.


### Topics to cover in each language
Each of these depend on the language, if the language has interfaces, then cover them.


* interfaces/inheritance
* threading/parallelism/async
* Data types
 * maps
 * queue
 * tree
 * graph
 * linked list
* Sorts
 * Bucket sort
 * Bubble sort
 * Insertion sort
 * Selection sort
 * Heapsort
 * Mergesort
